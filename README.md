# CA16
GCSE Computing Gaming Task GitHub Template




How do I GitHub?
-----

[GitHub](https://github.com) is a widely-used VCS (<b>V</b>ersion <b>C</b>ontrol <b>S</b>ystem) which  is used throughout the tech world (*honestly, from Minecraft to  JQuery to BourneToCode*). 
As it is used so widely in the real world, now is the perfect point to get started.

So far, all the work we have done in our CA is spread wildly throughout our school computers, maybe a bit at home, maybe some stored with Lucidchart and honestly it's not easy to mark or to keep track of for anyone.  
GitHub is the solution to this; this repository (see the Glossary) is a basic template of all the work that needs doing for the Gaming Task.
All you need to do, is to *fork* this and then to upload all of your current work.


####Setting Your Repository Up

![Fork Sign](https://github.com/fabcooldog/Odds-and-Sods/blob/master/GitHub%20Fork%20Sign.JPG)

 1. <b>Fork this repository</b> -  In the top right-hand corner of this page there should be a '*Fork*' button, press it! 
 2. After a moment of waiting, you should be faced with your very own copy of the repository *CA16*.</l>
 3. Now all that needs doing is to fill up your copy with your work.
 4. When making changes to a repository, you use '*commits*'; basically just saving a file. 
 e.g. I might add '*Flowchart.png*' to '*Part1files*':
	1. Go into the folder where you'd like the files to end up.
	2. Guess what, press '*Upload Files*' to upload files!

	3. Then, drag or select files to add into a certain location. (e.g. Flowchart.png)
	4. Title your commit with a friendly message. (e.g. '*Added Flowchart to Part1files*)
	5. Press Commit Changes!

 5. Get back to work and at the end of each lesson, upload any new files to your repository.





###Glossary:

- **Branch**
A branch is a parallel version of a repository. It is contained within the repository, but does not affect the master branch allowing you to work freely without disrupting the "live" version. When you've made the changes you want to make, you can merge your branch back into the master branch to publish your changes.

- **Collaborator**
A collaborator is a person with read and write access to a repository who has been invited to contribute by the repository owner.

- **Commit**
A commit, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set of files). It's like when you save a file, except with GitHub you can choose to '*rollback*' to an older commit if it all goes pear-shaped. Commits usually contain a commit message which is a brief description of what changes were made.

- **Contributor**
A contributor is someone who has contributed to a project by having a pull request merged but does not have collaborator access.

- **Fork**             
A fork is a personal copy of another user's repository that lives on your account. Forks allow you to freely make changes to a project without affecting the original. You can also keep your fork up to date by pulling in updates from the original.

- **Git**
Git is an open source program for tracking changes in text files. It was written by the author of the Linux operating system, and is the core technology that GitHub, the social and user interface, is built on top of.


- **Markdown**
Markdown is an incredibly simple file format, not dissimilar from .doc, .rtf and .txt. it is the main mark-up language supported by GitHub.

- **Merge**
Merging takes the changes from one branch and applies them into another, '*merging*' them together.

- **Pull**
Pull refers to when you are fetching in changes and merging them. For instance, if someone has edited the remote file you're both working on, you'll want to pull in those changes to your local copy so that it's up to date.

- **Repository**
A repository is the most basic element of GitHub. They're easiest to imagine as a project's folder. A repository contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.
